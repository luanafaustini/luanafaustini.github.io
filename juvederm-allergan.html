                <p>Juvéderm, a product of Allergan Aesthetics, needed a website redesign that’d work globally for branded and unbranded markets using a modular mindset, user-centered design and mobile-first approach.</p>
                <p>The website should be the place to make the final consumers see themselves within the category (facial fillers, as opposed to onabotulinumtoxinA or plastic surgery) and to provide information and tools to lead them to book a consultation.</p>

                <p>Technology enables user empowerment and engagement, and a satisfying experience goes beyond mere usability. We used microinteractions to enhance the website's look and feel, making it more engaging and enjoyable.</p>

            <div class="subcomp-text">
                <p>During the project’s progress, it was needed to decrease the scope of pages and simplify the sitemap due to possibility of content creation.</p>
                <br>
                <p><span class="label">What I’d do differently:</span> It would have been better to integrate the content into the design process at an earlier stage to allow us to take even more of a form-follows-function approach and further optimise the user experience for engagement and conversion rates.</p>
