                <p>Juvéderm, a product of Allergan Aesthetics, needed a website redesign that’d work globally for branded and unbranded markets using a modular mindset, user-centered design and mobile-first approach.</p>
                <p>The website should be the place to make the final consumers see themselves within the category (facial fillers, as opposed to onabotulinumtoxinA or plastic surgery) and to provide information and tools to lead them to book a consultation.</p>

                <p>During the project’s progress, it was needed to decrease the scope of pages and simplify the sitemap due to possibility of content creation.</p>
                <p>Overwall, I’m pleased with the outcome and progression that we’ve made, as well as the sincere and trustworthy relationship we were able to create between us as a team and together with the client.</p>
                <p><span class="label">What I’d do differently:</span> I’d have stressed the importance of bringing the content team in an earlier stage, so specific content modules would be designed more purposefully.</p>
                <p>I’d also like to have had the possibility of doing a proper UX research with the final user other then workshop conducted internally.</p>
