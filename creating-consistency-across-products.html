                <p>As a world-leading diagnostic imaging solutions provider, it was needed a UX and UI solution that would unite and organize their product portfolio with cohesiveness, intuitive navigation and a modern interface. The first step after making an interface inventory was to start building their first Design System.</p>
                <p>Navigating towards standardization and consistency, it was equally  important to set processes so a brand of this magnitute could scale accordingly and in a healthy way.</p>

            <div class="subcomp-text">
                <p>This Design System to-be should be shared (and followed) across multiple projects, so advocate about the benefits of the implementation of a Brand Design System was crucial: keep visual consistency across multiple products, facilitate turnover between professionals, optimizing production and development, and promptness to launch new pages.</p>
                <p>After research and benchmarking, it was chosen to apply the Atomic Design methodology to create atoms, molecules, organisms and templates, bringing it to life.</p>

                <p>Within the account, there are several subproducts that are managed by different Project Managers (PM). The process to conduct each project is shaped and vary depending of each PM, so I took the liberty to map and create a process matrix with all characters and their tasks. This way everybody have visibility of next steps and when and how they will be needed.</p>
                <p>The complete design process can be accomplished once, or anytime that one finds necessary, but after gathering information, findings can be applied across different subproducts and the steps with gray background could be skipped.</p>

            <div class="subcomp-text">
                <p>There are other steps that should intersect this outcomes - like meetings and workshops to present and explain each solution so all collaborators are familiar with the processes.</p>
                <p>Having in mind that a brand of this size has a substantial amount of turnover of professionals, I would also recommend a standardization of onboarding to expedite the process, keep the work consisten and make the new collaborator more comfortable and confident.</p>
